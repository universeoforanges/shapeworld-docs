# Ugly Placeholder

Bro why would you scroll all the way down here are you bored or something???
Even I could find something better to do, like getting a life and knowing how to write **bold** text!
or *italics*!
or a ***mix***!!!
Or get a life and start knowing how to write python code: like this!!
````python
print("Hello Life")
````
Or your most hated programming language??
````javascript
console.log("This language sucks (No offense)")
````

Or getting smarter to know how to write:

## HEADINGS!!

## **BOLDER HEADINGS!!**

OR SIMPLE Code: like this...
`wow. not even code.`
Try.
````python
def try():
    print("YOU IS TRYING")
    print("FAILED CUZ OF BORDEM")

try
````
````javascript
alert("idk i dont learn javascript")
````
````c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout<<"YOU FAILED OF TRYING";

    return 0;
}
````

````bash
echo Failed because u cant try
````

ight you made me bored too so everything down here is gonna be boring like you are right now like go do
something else good instead of scrolling like a tiktoker

## big
## getting smaller
### pls no
#### ant
##### bacteria
###### atom
````python
asked = false
def never_asked():
    if never_asked == false:
        print("BYE I NEVER ASKED")
````

[hide]: #
